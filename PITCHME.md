@snap[west]
@ul[spaced text-black]
- Clean, pleasant to use and less boilerplate
- Now more widely used in the Kotlin community 
- Plenty of features
- E.g. Easy mocking of private functions, constructor mocking, coroutine mocking etc
- Which would potentially be useful for new work

@[1-2]

A 'relaxed' mock is a mock that returns some simple value for all functions.
<br>
This allows to skip specifying behavior for each case, while still allow to stub things you need.

Mockk is 'strict' by default, unless specified otherwise

#### Opinions from a Mockito user
@snapend

@snap[south-west]
@ul[spaced text-black]
- Easier to use/less snags than Mockito e.g. chained calls
- More functional approach which is suited to Kotlin
- More human readable e.g. someMock wasNot Called (good use of infix function)
- Slightly less docs but more appearing now it is being widely adopted (great github page/glossary)
- Potentially our de facto mocking framework?
